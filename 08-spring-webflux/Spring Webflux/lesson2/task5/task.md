# Other Backpressure Strategies in Reactive Programming

In reactive programming, backpressure is a mechanism to handle the scenario where a subscriber cannot keep up with the rate of incoming data from a publisher. Here are three common strategies to deal with backpressure.

## 1. `drop()` - Dropping Excess Elements

If the subscriber is too slow, we can drop elements instead of buffering them.

### Example: Using `onBackpressureDrop()`

```java
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;
import java.time.Duration;

public class Task {
    public Flux<Integer> dropExample() {
        return Flux.range(1, 100)
                .delayElements(Duration.ofMillis(1))
                .onBackpressureDrop(i -> System.out.println("Dropped: " + i)); // Drop items when overwhelmed
    }
}
```
- Use When:
We don't need every element, and losing some data is acceptable.
- Real-World Use Case:
Logging systems, sensor data (where only the latest values matter).

## 2. `latest()` - Keeping Only the Most Recent Value

If a slow subscriber cannot keep up, we drop old values but keep the latest.

### Example: Using `onBackpressureLatest()`

```java
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;
import java.time.Duration;

public class Task {
  public Flux<Integer> latestExample() {
    return Flux.range(1, 100)
            .delayElements(Duration.ofMillis(1))
            .onBackpressureLatest(); // Only keep the latest value when overwhelmed
  }
}
```
- Use When:
  The latest value is more important than historical values.
- Real-World Use Case:
  Stock prices, real-time data dashboards, sensor readings.

## 2. `error()` - Throwing an Error on Backpressure

Instead of handling backpressure, we fail fast and throw an error.

### Example: Using `onBackpressureError()`

```java
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;
import java.time.Duration;

public class Task {
  public Flux<Integer> errorExample() {
    return Flux.range(1, 100)
            .delayElements(Duration.ofMillis(1))
            .onBackpressureError(); // Throw error if subscriber is too slow
  }
}
```
- Use When:
  We need strict processing and can't tolerate data loss.
- Real-World Use Case:
  Payment processing, transactional systems.

## Find All Prime Numbers in a Range Using Flux

The goal is to take a range of numbers (for example, 1 to 100), filter out non-prime numbers, and only emit the prime numbers.

### Prime Number Algorithm:
A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.
We need to check each number in the given range to determine if itâ€™s prime.

1. Create Controller with start and end params
2. Filter out non-prime numbers in a range
3. Emit only prime numbers

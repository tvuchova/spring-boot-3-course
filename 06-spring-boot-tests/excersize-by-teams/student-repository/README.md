# Student Repository

## Getting Started



### H2 In-memory Database

This project uses H2 in-memory database as we do not need to persist the data. By default, it is volatile and all stored data loss when we restart the application.

### Build the Spring Boot application

Verify the installation of Maven

```
mvn -v
```

Build your Spring Boot application

```
mvn clean install
```

### Run the Spring Boot Application

Now that your application is compiled, letâ€™s run it with the following command

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Access the application at http://localhost:8080/students or  http://localhost:8080/

Access the H2 database after you've run the application at http://localhost:8080/h2-console. Make sure to check the `application.properties` file for correct information asked when accessing the in-memory database.

### Stop the application

Terminate your current terminal to stop the application as well as free up the current port.
